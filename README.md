## Goal
Amazing Prime is hosting a "Hackathon", encouraging teams to create an algorithm that helps the movie streaming service find low-budget films that promise high-popularity. This project creates a SQL database that can be used by the "Hackathon" teams when developing their algorithm. My final product is a clean SQL database that combines movie data from Wikipedia and Kaggle that includes necessary information about the film as well as ratings data.
